Hard work is undoubtedly a significant factor in achieving success, but there's another crucial element at play – timing. It's about being in the right place at the right moment, seizing opportunities as they arise, and connecting with others at just the right time.

Movies reflect this aspect of life brilliantly. The impact of a film on us depends not just on its content, but also on when we watch it. The right movie at the right time can make us laugh, cry, or reflect. It's a personal experience, unique to each viewer.
